# Part 6 - Advanced state management

In this part of the course, we learned about state management in larger React applications. We discovered that placing the application's state and state logic directly inside React components can become unwieldy as the application grows larger. To address this issue, we introduced the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.

## Topics

### Redux

We explored the Flux architecture and how it inspired the creation of Redux. We also learned about the Redux store, reducers, and actions. We discovered how to create multiple reducers to handle different parts of the application's state, and how to use middleware to handle asynchronous actions. We learned how to communicate with the server in a Redux application, and how to use Redux DevTools to debug our code.

### React Context and useRedux Hook

We also learned about the lightweight version of Redux that is directly supported by React, namely the React context and useRedux hook. We discovered how to use these tools to manage the application's state without having to use the full Redux library.

### React Query

In addition to Redux, we also covered the React Query library that simplifies the server state management. We learned how to use the useQuery hook to fetch data from the server, and how to use the useMutation hook to update the server's data. We also explored how React Query simplifies cache management and error handling.

### Connect (the Old Part)

Finally, we briefly touched on the Connect component, which was previously covered in the course. We learned how Connect allows us to connect our React components to the Redux store and access the application's state and actions.

Overall, this part of the course gave us a solid foundation in state management in larger React applications. We learned how to use Redux and React Query to manage the application's state and communicate with the server. We also discovered how to use React Context and useRedux to manage state in a more lightweight manner.
